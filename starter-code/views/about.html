    <h1>Who is Leticia Sabater?</h1>

    <h2>Family</h2>

    <p>She is the second of three daughters of the marriage between mining engineer Jorge Sabater de Sabatés[3] and his wife María del Carmen Alonso Martínez-Cobo of Guzmán (1944– 17 October 2010 at the age of 66 years).[4] Her sisters' names are Silvia and Casilda.</p>
        
    <h2>Televisión Española (TVE) (1986–1991)</h2>

    <p>Her debut in front of the cameras was in 1986 as "chica de figuración" in the program Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez. Later, she would appear as a hostess during the Vuelta a España alongside Gina o Lore. In 1989, she became a "chica Hermida" when she was joined Por la mañana, the program hosted by Jesús Hermida on Televisión Española.</p>

    <p>In April 1990 she had the opportunity to present her first children's programming, No te lo pierdas ("Don't miss it"), with Enrique Simón. No te lo pierdas filled the gap in the programming left by Cajón desastre ("Grab bag"), by Miriam Díaz Aroca, and it remained on the air for a year. The show's representation changed the stereotypes of children's programs, since, according to some, its hosts had a cooler, more casual tone.</p>

    <p>This same year she began a musical career with the launch of the single Tu vecina favorita, which was about the subject of the same name, and the song En tu casa o en la mía. The songs reached the 14th and 36th slots, respectively, in the list of Los 40 Principales. A year later, she recorded the children's album Nosotros somos el mundo ("We are the world"), with collaborations with stars like Marco and Sabater's previous co-stars Gina and Lore. Her second album, a younger cut, launched in 1993 under the title Leticia; in 1994 her third album, Leti Funk, came out. Her last album was Con Mucha Marcha, in 1997, which contained versions of classic children's songs like "la canción del colacao".</p>

    <p>In 1991 she had a small experience interpreting on the Mariano Ozores series Taller mecánico.</p>
